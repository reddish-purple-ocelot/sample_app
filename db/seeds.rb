# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:

# admin = User.create(name:'Valya', 
											# role:'admin',
											# email:'val.slyun@gmail.com', 
											# remember_token:'',
											# password_digest: '')
